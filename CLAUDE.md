## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Branching Rules

- **NEVER commit directly to `source`.** All work must happen on a feature branch.
- Every builder creates their own branch off `source` (e.g. `fix/bug-name`, `feat/feature-name`).
- When done: open a PR against `source`, get it reviewed, then squash-merge.
- Before starting work: always `git checkout source && git pull origin source` to get latest.
- If another builder's PR merges while you're working: rebase your branch (`git rebase source`) before opening your PR.
- Multiple builders CAN work simultaneously — branches keep everyone's work isolated.
- **COMMIT EARLY, COMMIT OFTEN.** As soon as a file edit is in a working state, commit it on your feature branch — *before* running typecheck, build, code review, or any other long-running step. Uncommitted changes are evaporated by `git pull` / branch-switch / `npm run deploy` (which calls `git add -A` on the parent repo), and parallel builders WILL trigger one of those while you're mid-flight. We've lost hours of work to this; treat an uncommitted edit as already-deleted. Use `git stash` for genuinely experimental WIP — never as a substitute for committing.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Worktrees for parallel builders

**Two builders sharing one working tree will overwrite each other's `HEAD`.** That's how 2026-05-02's misroute happened: builder A ran `git checkout -b fix/...` to start work; builder B then ran `git checkout feat/...` for theirs; A's next commit landed on B's branch because both shared one `HEAD`. Use git worktrees so each builder has an isolated `HEAD`, index, and working tree while sharing the same `.git` (objects, refs, remote).

### Starting a session

From the canonical clone, create a worktree on a new branch in one step:

```bash
cd /c/dev/Stride-GS-app
git fetch origin source
git worktree add -b fix/<scope>/<desc> /c/dev/stride-<topic> source
cd /c/dev/stride-<topic>
```

The `-b` form creates the new branch AND the worktree at `source`'s tip in one command. Don't omit `-b` and try to check out `source` directly — that fails with `'source' is already used by worktree at 'C:/dev/Stride-GS-app'` because the canonical clone has `source` checked out. Each branch can be in at most ONE worktree at a time; that's the lock that prevents HEAD-stomping in the first place.

`<topic>` should be short and unique among active worktrees. Examples: `stride-cancel-wc`, `stride-task-addons`, `stride-billing-fix`. Don't reuse names across active sessions.

### First time in a fresh worktree: install deps

`node_modules` is **not** shared between worktrees (only `.git` is — that's by design). Before `tsc --noEmit` / `npm run build` / `npm run deploy` will work, install:

```bash
cd /c/dev/stride-<topic>/stride-gs-app && npm install --no-audit --no-fund
cd /c/dev/stride-<topic>/AppScripts/stride-client-inventory && npm install --no-audit --no-fund   # only if you'll deploy GAS
```

npm's cache is shared across worktrees, so the second install in any worktree usually finishes in <10 seconds. `package-lock.json` is tracked, so the install is deterministic.

If you'll touch the React app, also copy `.env` from the canonical clone (it's gitignored, so `git worktree add` doesn't carry it):

```bash
cp /c/dev/Stride-GS-app/stride-gs-app/.env /c/dev/stride-<topic>/stride-gs-app/.env
```

Without this, the production bundle silently inlines `VITE_SUPABASE_URL = undefined` and crashes at module load with `Uncaught Error: supabaseUrl is required.` (Caught in session 72 by a live-site error — the build itself doesn't fail.)

### Ending a session

After your PR merges:

```bash
cd /c/dev/Stride-GS-app
git worktree remove /c/dev/stride-<topic>
```

If you abandon work without merging, add `--force` to the remove. The `.git/worktrees/<topic>` admin folder is auto-cleaned.

### Listing + pruning

```bash
git worktree list      # show all active worktrees
git worktree prune     # garbage-collect stale worktree metadata
```

### What stays in the canonical clone

`/c/dev/Stride-GS-app` itself is the canonical clone (where `.git` lives). Use it for:
- One-off shell tasks (`git status`, `git log`, `git fetch`)
- Source-of-truth `source` checkouts
- Creating + removing worktrees

Avoid doing feature work directly in the canonical clone when other builders may be active — go to a worktree instead.

### npm scripts + worktrees

`npm run deploy` (in `stride-gs-app/`) calls `git add -A` on the parent repo. With worktrees, each has its own index, so the `add -A` only stages files in *your* worktree — adjacent builders' WIP isn't swept up. Still: commit early, commit often.

The GAS deploy scripts (`npm run push-api`, `npm run deploy-api` from `AppScripts/stride-client-inventory/`) work the same in any worktree — they read local file content and POST to Apps Script.

## Do NOT use these skills

`stride-wms-domain`, `stride-build-instructions` — those are for the separate Stride WMS web app, not this project.

## Rules

### Must-do

- **BRANCH FIRST.** See [⚠️ CRITICAL: Branching Rules](#-critical-branching-rules) above. Stream prefixes used here: `feat/warehouse/*`, `feat/delivery/*`, `feat/fix/*`.
- **Deploy AFTER merge.** `git checkout source && git pull origin source` then deploy commands.
- **Deploy before reporting done.** Execute via Bash, don't just describe.
- **TypeScript must stay clean** — run `npx tsc --noEmit` (or `node node_modules/typescript/lib/tsc.js --noEmit`) before finishing.
- **Version header on every `.gs`/`.js` edit.** Patch bump for fixes, minor for features. PST timestamps.
- **Header-based column mapping.** Use `getHeaderMap_()` / `headerMapFromRow_()`. Never positional indexes.
- **Use existing components** — check `src/components/shared/` (60 components) before creating new ones.
- **Use existing hooks** — check `src/hooks/` (61 hooks) before creating new ones.
- **Follow the design system** — Stride orange (#E85D2D), Inter font, `theme.v2` tokens. See `_archive/Docs/Entity_Page_Design_Spec.md` for entity page design.
- **Update BUILD_STATUS.md at end of session.**

### Must-not-do

- **Never use `getLastRow()` for insert positions** — use `getLastDataRow_()`.
- **React never calculates billing.** All billing logic stays server-side in Apps Script.
- **Never deploy from a worktree without merging to source first.** Silent reverts have broken the live app twice.
- **Never edit `dist/` by hand.** Only `npm run build` writes there.
- **Never edit the Master Price List sheet directly.** Use Price List page → inline edit → Sync to Sheet.
- **Never commit `.env`, `.credentials.json`, or any secrets.**
- **Never re-enable GitHub Actions `deploy.yml`/`ci.yml`** — renamed `*.disabled`. (CI runners hit the same Windows schannel TLS instability the local deploy script now retries around — but reactivating CI for it is a separate project.)

---

## Doc Updates (end of session)

Every builder session must update these docs before reporting done:

**CODE_MAP.md** — Append entries for any new files created (pages, hooks, components, edge functions, migrations). If an existing feature area gained new files, add them to the existing section. Format: feature area → layer → file path.

**BUILD_STATUS.md** — Update "Recent Changes" with a summary of what was built/fixed this session. Include file locations so future builders can find the code. Update version numbers in the "Current Versions" table if any system version changed. Check off completed items in "Pending User Actions" if resolved.

**FEATURE_BACKLOG.md** — Check off any features that were completed this session. Add any new feature requests discussed with Justin that weren't built yet.

**Session_History.md** (`_archive/Docs/Archive/`) — Add a one-liner for this session: date + compressed summary of everything touched.

---

## Build Process

Every change must go through this sequence before being shipped:

1. **Branch first** — `git checkout source && git pull origin source && git checkout -b feat/<stream>/<desc>`. Streams: `feat/warehouse/*`, `feat/delivery/*`, `feat/fix/*`. Never edit files on `source`.
2. **Write changes** — edit source files in `C:\dev\Stride-GS-app\stride-gs-app\src\`
3. **Commit immediately** — `git commit -am "..."`. Do this as soon as the edits compile in your head — *before* typecheck/build/review. A parallel builder's `git pull` or `npm run deploy` will erase any uncommitted file in your working tree without warning. See [⚠️ CRITICAL: Branching Rules](#-critical-branching-rules).
4. **Type-check** — `node node_modules/typescript/lib/tsc.js --noEmit` (zero errors required). If it fails, fix and amend or add a commit — never leave the fix uncommitted.
5. **Full build** — `npm run build` (catches real bundler/vite errors the type-check misses)
6. **Code review** — spawn an Opus 4.7 subagent to review all diffs before merging
7. **PR + merge + deploy** — `git push -u origin <branch>` → `gh pr create --base source` → `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` → `git checkout source && git pull` → `npm run deploy -- "what changed"`

Do not skip steps. `tsc --noEmit` passing is not sufficient — always run `npm run build` to catch vite-level errors. Steps 1 and 3 are the ones that historically get skipped and cause the most pain.

## Tech Stack

- **Build:** Vite + React 18 + TypeScript
- **Tables:** TanStack Table v8
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Router:** HashRouter (GitHub Pages SPA compatibility)
- **State:** React hooks + TanStack Query patterns (useApiData)
- **Supabase:** Read cache mirror of all entities + auth + DT integration + messaging + audit log

└── types/               ← TypeScript type definitions
```

## API Connection

- **Endpoint:** StrideAPI.gs deployed as "Execute as Me, Anyone can access"
- **Auth:** Token via query parameter (`?token=xxx`)
- **Config:** Settings → Integrations → API Connection (URL + token stored in localStorage)
- **Pattern:** `apiFetch<T>(action, params?)` → returns typed data or throws
- **Hooks:** `useApiData(fetchFn)` → `{ data, loading, error, refetch }`

## Supabase

- **Migration files:** `stride-gs-app/supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_name.sql` (57 migrations applied)
- **Apply migrations:** MCP tool `apply_migration(project_id='uqplppugeickmamycpuz', name, query)`. Write the SQL file first (git source of truth), then apply via MCP.
- **Client:** `stride-gs-app/src/lib/supabase.ts` — anon key in `.env` as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Edge Functions (6 deployed):** dt-backfill-orders, dt-push-order, dt-sync-statuses, dt-webhook-ingest, notify-new-order, stax-catalog-sync

## Role-based access

3 tiers: admin (full), staff (no billing/claims/payments/settings/delivery), client (own data only). Enforced in Sidebar nav arrays + `RoleGuard` route wrapper.

## Deploy Reference

**Golden rule:** Web App deployments are frozen snapshots. `push-*` pushes source; `deploy-*` makes it live.

React commands run from `C:\dev\Stride-GS-app\stride-gs-app\`.
AppScripts commands run from `C:\dev\Stride-GS-app\AppScripts\stride-client-inventory\`.
Never deploy from a worktree.

| Change touched… | Command | Live in |
|---|---|---|
| React (`src/**`) | `npm run deploy -- "what changed"` (build → push dist → commit source) | 1–2 min |
| Supabase migration | MCP `apply_migration` | seconds |
| StrideAPI.gs | `npm run push-api && npm run deploy-api` | ~20s |
| Consolidated Billing | `npm run push-cb && npm run deploy-cb` | ~20s |
| Client scripts (×49) | `npm run rollout && npm run deploy-clients` | 3–4 min |
| Email/doc templates | Edit in app (Settings → Templates) | instant |
| Service rates/catalog | Price List page → inline edit | instant |

**React build safeguards:** `npm run build` routes through `scripts/build.js` (verify-entry → tsc → vite → sanity checks). `npm run build:raw` disables guards — emergency only.

**Windows schannel TLS retry:** `scripts/deploy.js`'s `pushWithRetry` helper auto-retries any failing `git push` with `-c http.postBuffer=524288000 -c http.version=HTTP/1.1` — the recurring `SEC_E_MESSAGE_ALTERED (0x8009030f)` failure on the ~3MB bundle push has been reproducible enough that retry is built in. If you ever need to push manually (e.g. a recovery from a partial deploy), use the same flags.

**All-at-once after a big session:**
```bash
cd AppScripts/stride-client-inventory
npm run push-api && npm run deploy-api
npm run rollout && npm run deploy-clients
# Then React (from stride-gs-app/):
cd ../../stride-gs-app
npm run deploy -- "session summary"
```

---

## Architecture (compact)

```
Master Price List     →  pricing, class map, email/invoice templates (Supabase-authoritative now)
Consolidated Billing  →  storage charges, invoicing, client mgmt, QB export
Client Inventory (×N) →  per-client sheet: Inventory, Shipments, Tasks, Repairs, Will_Calls, Billing_Ledger
StrideAPI.gs          →  Web App doPost endpoint backing the React app
React app             →  GitHub Pages, reads StrideAPI + Supabase cache
Supabase              →  read cache mirror + DT delivery + messaging + audit log + auth
```

**Data flow:** GAS writes → Google Sheet (authoritative) → Supabase (best-effort write-through) → Realtime → React hooks refetch → UI updates in ~1–2s across all tabs.

**Key invariant:** Supabase is a read cache, not authority. GAS writes are the execution authority. Never block a GAS write on a Supabase failure.

## Deep Links — DO NOT BREAK

Email CTAs link to the React app and auto-open entity panels. **Always use query-param format with `&client=`:**
```
https://www.mystridehub.com/#/tasks?open=INSP-62391-1&client=<spreadsheetId>
```
Never route-style (`/#/tasks/INSP-62391-1`) — Gmail strips the `#` fragment. Without `&client=`, the detail panel never opens.

---

## Billing schema (compact)

**Service codes:** `STOR`, `RCVG`, `INSP`, `ASM`, `MNRTU`, `WC`, `REPAIR`, `PLLT`, `PICK`, `LABEL`, `DISP`, `RSTK`, `NO_ID`, `MULTI_INS`, `SIT`, `RUSH`.

**Status values:** Billing: `Unbilled` → `Invoiced` → `Billed` | `Void`. Inventory: `Active` | `Released` | `On Hold` | `Transferred`. Tasks: `Open` | `In Progress` | `Completed` | `Failed` | `Cancelled`. Repairs: `Pending Quote` → `Quote Sent` → `Approved`/`Declined` → `In Progress` → `Completed`/`Failed`. Will Calls: `Pending` | `Scheduled` | `Partial` | `Released` | `Cancelled`.
