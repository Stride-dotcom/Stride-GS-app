## Recent Changes (2026-05-02, session 91 — perf sweep + worktree convention + billing-page audit close)

Late-day session that started as a single production fire (release-items timing out on multi-item orders) and turned into a full sweep of the per-cell `setValue`-in-loop antipattern across the GAS surface, plus closing out the billing-page audit's final follow-up. Two HEAD-stomp incidents from parallel-builder collisions in the canonical clone forced a process change: per-builder git worktrees, documented as a Critical Rule.

### PR #186 — handleReleaseItems_ bulk-write
- Production fire: releasing items on a 50+ item order was hitting GAS execution timeout (3 setValue() per item × 50 items × 500ms-2s/round-trip = 3-5 min). Refactored to collect all per-row mutations into in-memory arrays, compute the contiguous range covering changed rows, and write each affected column ONCE via `setValues`. Untouched-but-in-slice rows write back snapshot values so unrelated data isn't clobbered.
- 50-item release: ~3-5 min → <5 sec. Constant time regardless of item count.
- StrideAPI.gs v38.142.8, Web App v425.

### PR #187 — handleCreateInvoice_ ledger updates bulk-write
- Same antipattern in `api_markClientLedgerInvoiced_` + Email Status updates on Consolidated_Ledger inside `handleCreateInvoice_`. Up to 4 setValue() per ledger row × N rows on a monthly invoice (~200 lines = 800 round-trips, frequent timeouts).
- New code: 4 round-trips for client Billing_Ledger update + 1 for Consolidated_Ledger Email Status, regardless of N. StrideAPI.gs v38.142.9, Web App v426.

### PR #188 — handleCancelWillCall_ bulk-write (Class A)
- Smaller-scale variant — cancellation set 1 setValue per WC_Items row in a loop. 20-item WC = 1-2 min hang (not a timeout; users assumed click hadn't registered). Same recipe applied to the WC_Items Status column. Note: `wciData` here uses `getDataRange()` so includes the header at index 0 — sheet row R maps to `wciData[R-1]` (vs PR #186's wciData sliced from row 2). Captured inline.
- StrideAPI.gs v38.142.10, Web App v427.

### PR #190 — api_writeThrough_ batch path (Supabase mirror)
- Audit revealed every bulk handler also called `api_writeThrough_` afterward to mirror to Supabase, and that path was per-row: each ID = `SpreadsheetApp.openById` + `sheetToObjects_(sheet)` + linear scan + single-row `supabaseUpsert_` POST. So 50-item release-items had ~10-25 sec of writeThrough on top of the (already-fixed) sheet write.
- New `resyncEntitiesBatchToSupabase_` opens the sheet ONCE, reads `sheetToObjects_` ONCE, builds an id→row map, constructs all upsert objects in memory (using the same `sb*Row_` helpers `api_fullClientSync_` uses), and fires a single `supabaseBatchUpsert_(table, rows)`. That helper already chunks at 50 + retries per-row on chunk failure, so robustness for big batches is inherited.
- `api_writeThrough_` dispatches to the batch path when `ids.length > 1 && entityType !== "clients"`. Single-ID router cases (~25 sites) unchanged. On batch failure, falls back to the existing per-row loop so `gs_sync_events` still gets per-entity failure rows for the React FailedOperationsDrawer.
- Updated 4 batch handlers (`handleBatchCancelTasks_`, `handleBatchCancelRepairs_`, `handleBatchCancelWillCalls_`, `handleBatchReassignTasks_`) to pass `succeededIds` as an array. `handleReleaseItems_` already passed an array — picks up the batched path automatically.
- 50-item release writeThrough: ~10-25 sec → ~0.5-1 sec. batch-cancel-20-tasks: ~4-10 sec → ~0.5 sec.
- StrideAPI.gs v38.142.11, Web App v428.

### PR #191 — Class C handlers bulk-write
- `handleStartTask_`, `handleCompleteTask_`, `handleCompleteRepair_` were each doing 4-8 separate setValue() calls per request (one row across many columns) — 5-15 sec of latency. Sluggish enough that staff thought clicks weren't registering and clicked again.
- Refactored each: read full row once at function start (already happening), replace each `setValue` with `setRowVal_(col, val)` that mutates the in-memory rowData and tracks modified columns, then single `setValues` over the contiguous slice at end-of-try. Untouched-but-in-slice columns write back existing values from the snapshot.
- Also dropped a now-redundant `SpreadsheetApp.flush()` inside `handleCompleteTask_`'s Custom Price branch (the bulk write at end-of-try makes it meaningless; `resyncEntityToSupabase_` flushes itself before reading). `handleCompleteRepair_`'s `Email Sent At` setValue stays standalone — fires AFTER lock release in a separate control flow, doesn't multiply.
- Each handler now responds in <2 sec. StrideAPI.gs v38.142.12, Web App v429.

### PR #194 — handleBatchCancelWillCalls_ cascade fix + handleCancelWillCall_ duplicate-read cleanup
- Two cleanups picked from PR #188's "out of scope" list. (1) The bulk-cancel handler was re-reading the WC_Items snapshot inside its outer WC loop AND writing one setValue per cascaded item — for M WCs × N items, M reads + M·N round-trips. 5-WC × 20-item bulk cancel was ~60-180 sec. New code reads `wciData` ONCE before the outer loop, accumulates cancel-row sheet numbers across all WCs into `wciCancelRows`, single bulk setValues over the contiguous range at the end. Index-math note: this `wciData` is sliced from row 2 (no header), so sheet row R maps to `wciData[R - 2]` (differs from #188's `getDataRange()` form).
- (2) `handleCancelWillCall_`'s section-5 email-table builder no longer re-reads the sheet into `wciMap2`/`wciData2` — reuses the section-4 `wciMap`/`wciData` snapshot. Item-level fields don't change with cancellation, so the pre-write snapshot is identical for the email table (which only reads Item ID, Qty, Vendor, Description, Sidemark — not Status).
- StrideAPI.gs v38.143.1, Web App v431. (v38.143.0 was the parallel-shipped PR #193 task add-ons; my will-call cleanup landed on top as a patch bump.)

### PR #197 — per-builder worktree convention (chore/docs)
- Two HEAD-stomp incidents this session: builder A ran `git checkout -b ...` to start work, builder B then ran `git checkout ...` for theirs in the same canonical clone, A's next commit landed on B's branch because both shared one HEAD. Recovered by cherry-picking onto the right branch each time, but the second occurrence was while shipping THIS very PR — strong evidence the convention is needed.
- Added "⚠️ CRITICAL: Worktrees for parallel builders" section to CLAUDE.md (and stride-gs-app/CLAUDE.md mirror). Convention: `git worktree add -b fix/<scope>/<desc> /c/dev/stride-<topic> source` per session. Each worktree has its own HEAD/index/working-tree, shared `.git`. Git enforces "one worktree per branch," so collisions become physically impossible. Documented session-end cleanup (`git worktree remove`), npm-install requirement (`node_modules` not shared), and the existing "Never deploy from a worktree without merging to source first" rule (worktrees are for *building* in parallel; canonical clone is for *deploying* the merged result).

### PR #200 — Billing Category filter (closes billing-page audit PR 3)
- Added a `Category` MultiSelectFilter between Sidemark and Service on the Billing → Report tab. Categories derive from `useServiceCatalog` (already swapped from `usePricing` in #185 / audit PR 2). Selecting categories reactively narrows the Service dropdown via `SVC_OPTIONS_FOR_FILTER`. A `useEffect` drops service selections that fall out of view when categories change (no ghost selections hiding behind a category narrow).
- `BillingFilterParams.categoryFilter?: string[]` flows through both the Supabase path (`fetchBillingFromSupabaseFiltered` adds `.in('category', filters.categoryFilter)`) and the GAS path (URL param; handler may ignore — Supabase is primary read for billing). `billing.category` is already populated on every write, so no migration.
- Closes the billing-page audit's last open follow-up. PR 1 (seed INSURANCE) shipped in #183, PR 2 (services from Supabase) in #185, PR 3 (this one) in #200.

### Parallel work (other builders, same day)
- PR #185 — services filter from Supabase (audit PR 2). PR #189 — storage charges Postgres RPC + GAS commit-rows write-only (progress on long-term step 5 of the migration plan). PR #192 — respect `client.separate_by_sidemark` on invoice grouping (was always splitting). PRs #193 + #195 — billable task add-on services (`task_addons` table + AddTaskServiceModal + completion flow folds addon rows into Billing_Ledger). PRs #196 + #198 + #199 — BillingPreviewCard / BillingCalculator port from WMS (collapsible preview card + footer pill alignment + task-billing consolidation).

## Recent Changes (2026-05-02, session 90 — GAS→Supabase email migration batch)

### PR #174 — notify-new-order + notify-public-request route through send-email
- Both edge functions previously POSTed rendered HTML to GAS sendRawEmail. They now hand off to the `send-email` edge function (Resend) — drops `GAS_API_URL` / `GAS_API_TOKEN` deps, gets idempotency + `email_sends` audit rows for free.
- Idempotency keys: `order-review-request:<id>`, `public-request-confirm:<id>`, `public-request-alert:<id>`. Re-fires on the same order are deduped.
- Files: `stride-gs-app/supabase/functions/notify-new-order/index.ts`, `stride-gs-app/supabase/functions/notify-public-request/index.ts`. Deployed v8 / v3.

### PR #175 — ONBOARDING_EMAIL resend off GAS via send-onboarding-email
- New edge function `stride-gs-app/supabase/functions/send-onboarding-email/index.ts` (v1) resolves user → client (via `cb_users` + `clients`) → tokens → `send-email`. Replaces the GAS `sendOnboardingToUsers` path.
- Settings → Users → Resend Onboarding now calls the new function. Removed `postSendOnboardingToUsers` import from `Settings.tsx`.
- The GAS handler stays alive for activation / password-reset (those issue temp passwords + need the credentials-block fallback).

### PR #176 — CLAIM_STAFF_NOTIFY off GAS via React-side send-email
- `CreateClaimModal.tsx` now fires `sendEmail({ templateKey: 'CLAIM_STAFF_NOTIFY', tokens, idempotencyKey })` after `postCreateClaim` succeeds. Recipients resolve from `email_templates.recipients` (`{{STAFF_EMAILS}}`).
- `handleCreateClaim_` in StrideAPI.gs (v38.119.0) no longer sends CLAIM_STAFF_NOTIFY — keeping it would double-send. CLAIM_RECEIVED to claimant still on GAS for now.
- Deployed: GAS push + deploy-api (Web App v422), then React `npm run deploy`.

### PR #178 — claim status emails (CLAIM_RECEIVED + CLAIM_MORE_INFO + CLAIM_DENIAL)
- CreateClaimModal also fires CLAIM_RECEIVED to the claimant after postCreateClaim. ClaimDetailPanel fires CLAIM_MORE_INFO after postRequestMoreInfo and CLAIM_DENIAL after postSendClaimDenial. All three GAS-side sends stripped (StrideAPI.gs v38.120.0). Web App v423.
- CLAIM_SETTLEMENT stays on GAS — needs attachments (now landed in PR #182) AND the PDF source moved off Drive.

### PR #179 — notify-order-revision routes through send-email
- ORDER_REJECTED + ORDER_REVISION_REQUESTED no longer POST to GAS sendRawEmail. Edge function v3 ACTIVE; idempotency `${action}:${orderId}`.

### PR #180 — ACCOUNT_REFRESH_INVITATION off GAS
- Settings → Clients → Send Refresh Link now hits send-email with templateKey ACCOUNT_REFRESH_INVITATION. Same modal-edit override pattern as PR #169.

### PR #181 — cleanup: dead GAS handlers + React wrappers
- ~383 lines retired across StrideAPI.gs + api.ts. Handlers: sendIntakeInvitation, notifyIntakeSubmitted, sendOnboardingToUsers, emailSignedAgreement (all migrated earlier in the session). StrideAPI.gs v38.121.0, Web App v424.

### PR #182 — send-email attachments support
- Optional `attachments` array forwarded 1:1 to Resend (each item = `{filename, content (base64) | path (URL), contentType?}`). React wrapper (`src/lib/email.ts`) gets matching types. Edge function v5 ACTIVE.
- Unblocks INSP_EMAIL + CLAIM_SETTLEMENT migrations (each still needs the PDF source moved off Drive before they can ship).

## Recent Changes (2026-05-01, session 87)

### Email CTA &client= precedence + fetcher fallback (real fix for "Task Not Found")
- Symptom (after [#156](https://github.com/Stride-dotcom/Stride-GS-app/pull/156), [#159](https://github.com/Stride-dotcom/Stride-GS-app/pull/159), [#160](https://github.com/Stride-dotcom/Stride-GS-app/pull/160) had landed): inspection email CTA still landed on "Task Not Found" for INSP-62945-1 (Vida-Merit) and INSP-63026-1 (Vida-Waymark). Hard-refresh didn't help.
- Real cause: `api_sendTemplateEmail_` in StrideAPI.gs built the `&client=` suffix from `settings["CLIENT_SPREADSHEET_ID"]` first and the explicit `clientSheetId` param last. Older client sheets don't have that setting populated, so the suffix came out empty → auto-injected "Open in Stride Hub" CTA shipped without a tenant. The frontend fetcher then ran with no `&client=` and the unscoped path (which already existed) failed because the row was visible only after admin RLS bypass — but the legacy GAS fallback also didn't resolve.
- Fix server: reorder precedence so the authoritative `clientSheetId` param wins. Plus a final safety net that re-checks the chosen `ctaUrl` and appends `&client=` if it slipped through. StrideAPI.gs v38.142.7. Pushed + deployed (Web App v421).
- Fix frontend: `fetchTaskByIdFromSupabase` — scoped lookup miss now falls through to unscoped fetch; when multiple rows match unscoped and we have a hint, prefer the matching tenant. Stale / wrong / missing `&client=` on old emails no longer dead-end. PR #162.

### Auth: block authenticated transition until JWT carries user_metadata
- Symptom: even with the correct deep-link format, clicking an inspection email cold (e.g. INSP-63026-1) sometimes lands on "Task Not Found"; a manual refresh fixes it.
- Root cause: `AuthContext` fired `supabase.auth.updateUser({role, clientSheetId})` fire-and-forget and immediately marked the user authenticated. The first `useTaskDetail → fetchTaskByIdFromSupabase` query could race a stale JWT whose `user_metadata` lacked role/clientSheetId. The `tasks_select_staff` RLS bypass keys off `user_metadata.role`; with that missing even admin lookups returned 0 rows → "not-found".
- Fix: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` — both auth paths (cached fast-path + fresh GAS-verify) compare the live session JWT's `user_metadata` against the resolved user and only `await` `updateUser` when stale. Zero added latency when already in sync. PR #160.

### Email deep-link self-heal + WillCalls query-param fix
- WillCalls.gs (CREATED + RELEASE emails) shipped route-style URLs `/#/will-calls/<id>` with no `&client=`, which the React detail lookup rejects. Switched to `?open=<id>&client=<ssid>` per CLAUDE.md "Deep Links — DO NOT BREAK".
- Emails.gs `sendTemplateEmail_` gains a defensive self-heal that rewrites any leftover `/#/<entity>/<id>` URL (shipments|tasks|repairs|will-calls|inventory|claims) to query-param form with `&client=` before the existing missing-&client= patcher runs. Hand-edited templates can't ship the broken format.
- Investigation context: user reported "Task Not Found" from an INSP_EMAIL CTA for INSP-63026-1 (Vida-Waymark). The link format and the row are both fine; the proximate fix was [#156](https://github.com/Stride-dotcom/Stride-GS-app/pull/156)'s tenant-scoped fetcher (browser hard-refresh required to pick up the new bundle). This PR locks down the broader broken-link class.
- Versions: WillCalls.gs v4.6.1, Emails.gs v4.8.2. PR #159. Rolled out to all 52 clients.

### Photo upload routes to the active source-filter sub-tab
- Symptom: on the item Photos tab, switching the sub-filter to "Repair" and uploading still wrote the photo to the inventory item, not the repair.
- Root cause: `PhotoGallery` hard-coded the upload target to the host entity (`entity_type='inventory'`, `entity_id=item.itemId`); the sub-filter only filtered display.
- Fix: `usePhotos.uploadPhoto` accepts an optional `{entityType, entityId}` override (storage path + `item_photos` row stamp both honor it). `PhotoGallery` resolves the target from the active sub-tab using a new `relatedEntities` prop. Single match → upload routes to that entity; zero / multiple matches → button disabled with a tooltip. `ItemDetailPanel`'s `PhotosPanelProxy` threads `linkedTasks / linkedRepairs / linkedWillCalls / shipmentNumber` into the gallery. `PhotoUploadButton` gains a `disabledReason` tooltip prop. PR #158.

### Storage RLS tolerates `_` ↔ `-` in clientSheetId path prefix
- Symptom: Hillary @ Nip Tuck (client role) couldn't see photos on inventory items in her own account; admin "login as" worked fine.
- Root cause: `usePhotos` / `useDocuments` upload paths sanitize the tenant ID via `sanitizeTenantForPath` (replaces `_` with `-`), but the storage RLS policies (`photos_select_tenant`, `documents_select_tenant`) compared the raw JWT `clientSheetId` (with `_` preserved) against the sanitized path's first segment. Tenants whose ID contains `_` — Nip Tuck (`1_CINtvp...`) and ~10 others — got blocked from their own photos. Admin/staff bypassed via the role branch.
- Fix: `supabase/migrations/20260501010000_storage_rls_underscore_dash_tolerance.sql` — policies now accept either the raw or underscore-stripped form. Verified as Hillary: visible photos bucket objects rose 188 → 280 (+92 for Nip Tuck alone). Migration applied via MCP. PR #157.

### Task detail lookup scoped by tenant — fixes "Task Not Found" after transfer
- Symptom: item 62630 was received under J Garner (auto-inspect), then transferred to Nip Tuck (also auto-inspect). Both tenants ended up with `INSP-62630-1` in their Tasks sheet (J Garner CANCELLED via Transfer.gs, Nip Tuck COMPLETED). Clicking either row showed "Task Not Found".
- Root cause: task IDs are unique per-spreadsheet only (Tasks.gs `nextTaskCounter_` scans the local sheet). After transfer, both tenants hold rows with the same `task_id`. The detail fetch used `.eq('task_id', taskId).maybeSingle()`, which fails on duplicates.
- Fix: `src/lib/supabaseQueries.ts` — `fetchTaskByIdFromSupabase` accepts an optional `clientSheetId` and adds `.eq('tenant_id', clientSheetId)` to disambiguate. With no hint, returns null on multi-row matches so `useTaskDetail`'s legacy GAS scan can resolve.
- Nav plumbing: `src/pages/Tasks.tsx` row click, Task ID cell click, `__openTaskDetail`, `?open=` deep-link effect, and pending-open effect all now append `?client=<spreadsheetId>`. `src/pages/ItemPage.tsx` cross-link to tasks adds it. `src/pages/TaskPage.tsx` and `src/pages/TaskJobPage.tsx` parse `?client=` from URL and pass to `useTaskDetail` (new optional second arg). PR #156.

## Recent Changes (2026-04-30, session 86)

### Task ID always clickable on Tasks page
- `src/pages/Tasks.tsx` — Task ID column previously rendered as an orange Drive folder link only when `taskFolderUrl` was set, otherwise greyed-out unclickable text. Now always renders as an orange clickable link that navigates to `/tasks/${taskId}` (the in-app detail page). The Drive folder URL was legacy and shouldn't have gated clickability. `cols()` takes `navigate` parameter; useMemo deps updated to `[navigate]`. Repairs.tsx and WillCalls.tsx checked — neither uses the Drive-folder gating pattern, no changes needed. PR #145.

---

## Recent Changes (2026-04-30, session 85)

### Client access to delivery orders restored
- `src/pages/Orders.tsx` — clients with `RoleGuard`-allowed access to `/orders` couldn't actually see the Orders tab or the "+ New Delivery" button. Three gates were hardcoded `isAdmin` only: tab default, URL→tab resolver, and tab-content render. Replaced with `canViewOrders = isAdmin || isClient`. DT Sync button kept admin-only. Existing client-name filter (lines 162-171) already restricts visible rows to `accessibleClientNames`, so no extra RLS work was needed.

---

## Recent Changes (2026-04-30, session 84)

### Customizable add-on charges on delivery orders
- `src/components/shared/CreateDeliveryOrderModal.tsx` v5 — every selected add-on now exposes editable Qty + Rate inputs in both the entry screen and the Full Edit screen (same component, used in both contexts). Subtotal recomputes live as qty × rate for ALL units (previously `flat`/`plus_base` ignored qty so a flat $185 Disposal could only ever be one line of $185). Rate defaults to the catalog price; staff/admin can override; clients see rate locked but can still change qty. A "Modified" badge surfaces overrides to reviewers. Quote-required add-ons stay at $0/"Quote Required" until staff enters a rate, at which point they become a normal charge. Per-order rate persists in `dt_orders.accessorials_json[].rate` (column already existed; previously the catalog rate was re-looked-up at save time, overwriting any future override).

---

## Recent Changes (2026-04-26, session 83)

### Order revision/rejection emails
- New Edge Function `notify-order-revision` — sends `ORDER_REVISION_REQUESTED` or `ORDER_REJECTED` email when a reviewer flags an order. Recipients = office distro (NOTIFICATION_EMAILS secret) + the order submitter (resolved from `dt_orders.created_by_user` → `profiles.email`), deduped case-insensitively. Mirrors `notify-new-order`'s pattern (template lookup → token substitution → GAS sendRawEmail). Token values are HTML-escaped before substitution.
- Migration `20260426000000_order_revision_email_templates.sql` seeds two new `email_templates` rows. Both visually mirror `ORDER_REVIEW_REQUEST` (dark header, accent banner, detail table, footer) with action-specific colors: amber `#F59E0B` for revisions, red `#DC2626` for rejection. Editable in Settings → Email Templates the same as the rest.
- `src/pages/OrderPage.tsx` — added "Request Revision" button next to existing "Reject". Both prompt for notes via `window.prompt`, persist `review_status + review_notes + reviewed_by + reviewed_at`, then invoke `notify-order-revision` (best-effort — failures log warn but don't unwind the status change).

### dt-sync-statuses bug fix (v8)
- Filter switched from `dt_dispatch_id IS NOT NULL` to `pushed_to_dt_at IS NOT NULL`. App-pushed orders never get a dispatch ID (DT's `add_order` response is just `<success>...</success>`), so the old filter skipped them — they stayed "Awaiting DT Sync" forever. Lookup now passes `dt_identifier` to DT's `service_order_id` query param (which the XML spec confirms accepts the human Order_Number). Falls back to `dt_dispatch_id` for legacy webhook-imported rows.

## Recent Changes (2026-04-25, session 82)

### DT order Completion view + sync-back
- New migration `20260425230000_dt_sync_back_fields.sql` — adds completion columns to `dt_orders` (`started_at`, `finished_at`, `scheduled_at`, `driver_id`, `driver_name`, `truck_id`, `truck_name`, `service_unit`, `stop_number`, `actual_service_time_minutes`, `payment_collected`, `payment_notes`, `cod_amount`, `signature_captured_at`, `dt_status_code`, `dt_export_payload`); per-item delivery state to `dt_order_items` (`delivered`, `item_note`, `checked_quantity`, `location`, `return_codes`, `last_synced_at`); `lat`/`lng`/`source` on `dt_order_history`; allows `source='dt_export'` on `dt_order_notes`. Applied via MCP.
- `dt-push-order` **v15** — driver-facing `<notes>` block falls back to `dt_orders.details` when `order_notes` is empty so the modal's "Notes / Special Instructions" reaches the DT driver app's notes pane.
- `dt-sync-statuses` **v7** — replaced code-only `get_order_status` with `/orders/api/export.xml?service_order_id=…`. Mirrors back driver, truck, started/finished/scheduled, COD/payment, signature timestamp, per-item `delivered_quantity`/`item_note`/`return_codes`, full `order_history` timeline, and DT-side notes. Replace-on-sync scoped to `source='dt_export'` so app/webhook-authored rows survive.
- New `src/pages/OrderPage.tsx` **Completion tab** — renders driver/vehicle, timing (scheduled/started/finished/actual), proof-of-delivery (COD, signature_captured_at), DT-side notes feed, and driver-activity timeline (with Google Maps lat/lng deep-link). Items tab now shows "Delivered" / "Short" badges, driver-posted item notes, and return codes.
- New helpers in `src/lib/supabaseQueries.ts` — `fetchDtOrderHistory(dtOrderId)` and `fetchDtOrderNotes(dtOrderId)` returning `DtOrderHistoryEvent[]` / `DtSideNote[]`. Type extensions on `DtOrderForUI` + `DtOrderItemForUI` for the new sync-back columns.
- **Pending**: photo sync. DT XML export does not return photo URLs; the JSON Beetrack API (`GET /api/external/v1/dispatches/:identifier`) does, under `form.img_url[]`. Needs a separate `X-AUTH-TOKEN` from DT support before wiring.

### Scroll position restored on back-navigation
- New `src/hooks/useScrollRestoration.ts` — saves a scrollable container's `scrollTop` to `sessionStorage` (per-page key) on scroll (rAF-throttled). Restores once `isReady` flips true so the virtualizer has measured the full content height. Wired into all 5 list pages (Inventory / Tasks / Repairs / WillCalls / Shipments). Closes the loop on back-nav: dropdown + filters + sort + scroll position all restore.

### Client dropdown persists across navigation
- New `src/hooks/useClientFilterPersisted.ts` — drop-in replacement for `useState<string[]>([])` that persists each list page's client dropdown selection. Initial state precedence: URL `?client=` (resolved via apiClients, wins for email deep-links) → localStorage `stride_client_filter_<pageKey>` (last-used scope) → empty array (falls through to the page's role-default effect). Writes to localStorage on every change.
- Wired into all 5 list pages: Inventory / Tasks / Repairs / WillCalls / Shipments. Fixes the "click into an entity, hit back, dropdown is reset to all clients" pain. Sort + status filter + column visibility were already persisted via `useTablePreferences`; this closes the gap on the dropdown that was still useState-only.

### Back-button restores tab state across Orders / Settings / Billing
- New `src/hooks/useUrlState.ts` — single-key URL search-param state hook built on `useSearchParams`. `[value, setValue] = useUrlState(key, default, { replace? })`. Default pushes a history entry; `replace: true` for transient state. Empty string deletes the param so URLs stay short.
- `src/pages/Orders.tsx`, `src/pages/Billing.tsx`, `src/pages/Settings.tsx` — `activeTab` now lives in the URL via `useUrlState('tab', defaultTab)`. Settings also moves its `clientsSubTab` into `?subtab=`. Switching tabs pushes a history entry; back navigates to the prior tab. Email deep-links (`?tab=clients&subtab=intakes&intake=<id>`) survive subsequent navigation.
- The five list pages (Inventory/Tasks/Repairs/WillCalls/Shipments) didn't need conversion because they already moved to standalone `/inventory/:id`-style routes — back-button handles those natively.

### dt-push-order STRIDE LOGISTICS default fallback
- `supabase/functions/dt-push-order/index.ts` — `resolveAccountName()` now returns `'STRIDE LOGISTICS'` when `acctMap[tenantId]` is empty/missing (was: returned `''` and the caller errored 400). Pushes never fail for unmapped tenants; orders land on the house account and ops can reassign in DT's UI. The caller's `if (!accountName)` early-return is now unreachable but kept for defense in depth.

### Intake notification trigger — defensive EXCEPTION wrapper
- New migration `20260425200000_intake_notification_trigger_safe.sql` — wraps the INSERT inside `notify_admins_on_intake_submit()` in `BEGIN/EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS` so a notification failure cannot roll back the parent intake transaction. Today the trigger is owned by `postgres` (BYPASSRLS) so the unsafe version works fine, but a future RLS/constraint change won't silently drop intake rows. Notification becomes best-effort; intake row always lands.

### Dropbox-corruption signpost
- New `CLAUDE.md` at the Dropbox repo root (Dropbox-only file, gitignored locally) — directs any future Claude session that lands at the Dropbox path to switch to `C:\dev\Stride-GS-app`. Today's session burned ~30 min recovering git pack corruption that was caused by editing through Dropbox sync; the signpost prevents recurrence.
